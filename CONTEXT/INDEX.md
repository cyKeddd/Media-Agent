# CONTEXT Index — Media-Agent (Pivot.6)

Tech/AI news YouTube Shorts pipeline. Issues 39–41 + **43** complete; Issue 42 partial (ship/stability gates pending). **Dashboard v2 shipped** (Issues 47–50; health-first + approve/reject). v1 (44–46) superseded in UI. Backfill done; schedulers fixed; cumulative 250¢/clip cap + shot reuse on retry shipped.

## Domain terminology (sharpened)

- **Candidate script** — a row in `scripts` whose 4 shots have all succeeded in `generation_jobs` and whose narration has passed scripter-stage policy. Not yet a `clips` row.
- **Ship-verified** vs **complete** — see two-gate sign-off in review. A slice is *ship-verified* at T+1h (immediate uploader/disclosure path works) and *complete* at T+48h (no delayed CID, stability data clean).
- **AI-gen content** — anything where `clips.content_kind='ai_generated'`. Triggers the Slice 9 uploader branch (`containsSyntheticMedia=true`, AI-disclosure footer, no source/channel attribution).
- **Real-person reference** — naming or visually depicting an identifiable living individual. **Not allowed in scripter shot prompts.**

## Quick-reference: Current blockers (as of 2026-05-26)

1. ~~DB migration~~ / ~~MP4 assembly~~ / ~~live upload~~ — **DONE** (`youtube_video_id=9lpL8kuLX08`).
2. **T+1h ship gate (HITL)** — Studio checks on Slice 10 clip still pending.
3. **T+48h stability gate (Issue 13)** — passive monitoring.
4. **Pivot.7 hybrid spike (Issues 20/22)** — assembly + licensed sourcing fixed; live `spike_hybrid.py` not yet run.
5. **Uncommitted spike follow-ups** — `scripts/spike_hybrid.py`, `tests/assembler/test_assemble_mixed_res.py` (commit after Issue 20 spike pass).

## Document update protocol

When a grilling session locks new constraints, update three places:

1. **`progress.md`** — operational plan / checklist for the affected slice.
2. **`CONTEXT/` phase files** — durable constraints, defects, protocols.
3. **`docs/adr/`** — architectural decisions (sparingly).
