# Phase: planning
**Project:** Media-Agent (Pivot.6 → Pivot.7)
**Status:** in-progress
**Last updated:** 2026-05-30

## Objective

Lock the niche, content format, budget, weekly cadence, and tech stack direction for the Pivot.6 AI-generated YouTube Shorts pipeline. All strategic decisions were made in this phase; downstream phases implement them without debate.

## Key Decisions

- **Niche locked:** Tech/AI news Shorts only. No gameplay, no movie clips, no podcasts.
- **Content kind:** `ai_generated` — Kling 3.0 visuals + Edge TTS narration. No real footage.
- **Weekly output target:** 2 clips/week, $5 budget (OpenRouter Kling 3.0 std only).
- **Cadence:** 1 upload/day (slot-planned), weekly heavy run (`gen_run.py`) every Sunday.
- **Topic source:** RSS feeds — 7 feeds (Ars Technica, TechCrunch, The Verge, OpenAI, DeepMind, HuggingFace, VentureBeat). 48-hour recency window, Jaccard ≥ 0.6 dedup.
- **Script writer:** Ollama `qwen2.5:3b-instruct` (local, free). JSON-mode, 30–50 word narrations, 4 shots.
- **Video generator:** OpenRouter Kling 3.0 std (`kwaivgi/kling-v3.0-std`). $0.126/s billed at 5s minimum with audio.
- **Narration voice:** Edge TTS `en-US-GuyNeural`, +10% rate, 0Hz pitch.
- **Visual style suffix:** "clean editorial product photography, soft studio lighting, neutral backgrounds, minimalist composition, sharp focus, vertical 9:16, premium tech magazine look"
- **Human review:** `human_review: true` for first 2 weeks (filesystem gate — drag-to-approved).
- **Timezone:** Asia/Singapore.
- **AI disclosure:** Always-on. `status.containsSyntheticMedia=true` + description footer on every upload.
- **Music:** YouTube Audio Library only (CID safety). No other royalty-free sources.
- **Build order constraint:** Slices 3→7→6 first (free upstream pipeline) before Kling spend. Produce real scripts, validate quality, then top up OpenRouter.
- **Cost reality check (Slice 2 spike 2026-05-21):** Projected $0.34/shot; actual $0.63/shot. Kling bills 5s min with audio even when `enable_audio: False`. `per_clip_cost_cents_max: 350` (updated from 200).
- **Two-gate sign-off on first live upload (Slice 10):** T+1h ship gate + T+48h stability gate (ADR-0001).
- **Slice 10 ship bar = mechanics validation** (2026-05-24): test channel, "compliant + not embarrassing", not portfolio quality. Term defined in `CONTEXT/CONTEXT.md`.
- **Slice 10 lead frame = shot 3** (clinician + medical scan), order `3,2,1,0`. Supersedes "swap 0↔1 → whiteboard thumbnail": only shot 0 came from a named-person prompt; disclosure covers the generic synthetic clinicians; whiteboard frame has garbled AI text.
- **Slice 10 cost baseline = 315¢** (5 succeeded renders; shot 0 billed twice). Reconcile with `status='succeeded'`, not raw `SUM` (=621¢ incl. dry-runs).
- **Slice 10 stitch = `render_from_script.py --reuse-shots/--order`** (reuse paid shots, no regeneration) — reverses Issue 11's original "separate one-off script" approach.
- **First-ship slot decoupled** from steady-state cadence: same-day near-term slot (≈ now+45 min) so the T+1h gate can verify the public flip.
- **Steady-state cadence = Tuesdays & Thursdays** (Slice 11). Needs a new `upload_weekdays` allowlist + allocator weekday filter; `slot_planner` has no weekday support today. `clips_per_day` → 1 (2 clips/week, budget).
- **[2026-05-26] Project "done" defined:** autonomous loop (weekly `gen_run` + daily upload) ships **Hybrid clips** on Tue/Thu, first hybrid ship live-verified via the two-gate. Phase 8 stretch, quota-increase audit, and the scripter-quality grill are explicitly post-completion.
- **[2026-05-26] Hybrid is the default content path** — a Clip stays `ai_generated`; "hybrid" is the per-Shot mix (~2 real_image + ~2 ai_video). No toggle, no schema change.
- **[2026-05-26, ADR-0003] Licensed-only image sourcing for the autonomous path** — `web_fallback_enabled: false`, `sources: [logo, wikimedia, openverse]`; on licensed miss, degrade the real_image shot to ai_video before billing; web fallback stays for the manual spike/dev. `copyright_acknowledgement` → `hybrid_real_image_v1`.
- **[2026-05-26] First hybrid ship = first live ship under ADR-0001** (two-gate), because real_image sourcing is a new external-content surface even though `Content kind` is unchanged.
- **[2026-05-27, ADR-0004] Niche sharpened from broad "Tech/AI news" → AI-centric + flagship launches.** On-niche = center of gravity is AI (model/research release, or AI in a product) OR a major flagship hardware/OS launch (new iPhone, major iOS version, flagship GPU). Culture, entertainment, lawsuits/drama, minor tech are off-niche. Supersedes the broad niche line above.
- **[2026-05-27, ADR-0004] Hard relevance gate at ingest** — an LLM on/off-niche verdict drops off-niche topics *before* the `topics` insert (reject-before-persist + one debug log line). Closes the gap that let Topic #82 (OnlyFans) through.
- **[2026-05-27, ADR-0004] Topic selection = Significance × source-authority + Hacker News trending corroboration**, replacing the `novelty/specificity/tension` scorer (which rewarded "weird"; scored the OnlyFans story 6.9). HN is keyless/free; degrades gracefully.
- **[2026-05-27, ADR-0004] Feeds curated to AI-focused** — add Anthropic + Google AI; swap Verge/Ars main → AI subfeeds; keep OpenAI/DeepMind/HF; drop VentureBeat. Supersedes the 7-feed list above.
- **[2026-05-27] Real-image framing = true-aspect photo + slow zoom over a per-photo dominant-color gradient** (dark-clamped for white-subtitle contrast). Replaces blurred-bg fill and fixes the `zoompan s=WxH` stretch bug. (PRD, not ADR — bug fix + aesthetic.)
- **[2026-05-30] First live hybrid `gen_run` task scoped** — fix three spend/observability defects so a real `gen_run --clips 1` yields one Hybrid clip in `output/pending/`, stop at HITL review (Issue 29 ship stays separate). Defect fixes locked: (1) resolve **fetches-and-caches** (retire the search-only probe; degrade decision on a validated asset) → **ADR-0003 Refinement**; (2) niche gate **splits `infrastructure_failed` from `off_niche`** (fail-open + alert; prompt unchanged, retune deferred to live evidence); (3) **narration policy check before ai_gen billing**, removing the misfit legacy `policy_gate.run_all`.
- **[2026-05-30] Per-clip cost cap `270 → 250¢`** — budget basis $20/mo ÷ 8 videos = $2.50/video; at ~67¢/shot this rejects a 4-shot fully-degraded clip, so every clip must resolve ≥1 licensed image (an "at least minimally hybrid" floor). `daily_spend_cents_ceiling: 500` unchanged.
- **[2026-05-30] Prove via `gen_run` directly, not the throwaway spike** — Issue 20 (`spike_hybrid.py`) superseded; the fixes live in the gen_run path so gen_run is the stronger proof.
- **[2026-05-31] Steady-state path scoped (grill → PRD/issues).** Target = publish-day gates → autonomous Tue/Thu Task Scheduler. **Web review/calendar dashboard is the explicit next-up follow-on, captured but not built this round.**
- **[2026-05-31] Slot dedup:** hybrid `NPFJiqmd4ro` moved to **Thu 2026-06-04**; sample `qRdVYO1Tmfw` stays **Tue 2026-06-02**. The two-gate subject (`NPFJiqmd4ro`) now runs T+1h Thu 06-04 / T+48h ~06-06, standing alone on its slot.
- **[2026-05-31] Off-niche clip root cause = pre-gate backlog, NOT a classifier bug.** The reverse-aging clip came from topic #69 (fetched 2026-05-20, a week before the ADR-0004 ingest gate shipped 2026-05-27). 112 of 117 `unscripted` topics are pre-gate and the scripter draws the highest-scored one. **Fix = backfill-gate the legacy backlog** with the existing on-niche classifier (keep genuinely on-niche legacy items). The new-ingest gate works well (logs reject ~10 off-niche/run correctly). **Retires the deferred G3 prompt-retune;** scripter-framing drift (borderline-AI topic framed as non-AI) logged as a deferred scripter-quality follow-up only.
- **[2026-05-31] Enable-scheduler trigger = ship gate (T+1h Thu 06-04) + prereqs** (OpenRouter top-up, backlog backfill, Task Scheduler XML re-register). Stability gate (T+48h) monitored in parallel; `human_review` stays ON so every clip is still operator-approved. Per ADR-0001 the ship gate unblocks forward work.
- **[2026-05-31] `human_review` true→false trigger = evidence-based + calendar floor:** flip only when (a) first-hybrid stability gate passed, (b) ≥2 scheduler-driven weekly `gen_run` cycles reviewed with zero off-niche/policy/quality rejections, AND (c) ≥2 weeks elapsed since first hybrid ship (06-04). Calendar "2 weeks" is a floor, not the trigger.
- **[2026-05-31] Task Scheduler defects (block autonomy):** (a) `weekly_run.xml` runs stale `-m src.weekly_run` → must be `src.gen_run`; (b) both XMLs point at the stale `Documents\Media-Agent-main` repo copy, not the live `Desktop\Work\Media-Agent-main`; (c) verify a weekly run produces exactly **2 clips** (weekday allocator as count authority), not `clips_per_day×days_per_run=7`.
- **[2026-05-31] OpenRouter top-up = $20, done; auto-top-up now ON.** Balance is no longer a spend backstop — the config caps are the sole guardrail. Hard limit **2.5 credits (250¢)/video** (`per_clip_cost_cents_max: 250`) + `daily_spend_cents_ceiling: 500`, both unchanged; do not raise without approval. Watch retry double-billing on a single clip (the 252¢ reverse-aging retry already exceeded the 250¢ projection).

## Open Items

- ~~Slice 10 not yet ship-verified~~ — clip live (`9lpL8kuLX08`); T+1h/T+48h boxes elapsed, confirm-and-tick (Issues 12/13).
- ~~Slice 11 PRD/Issue 14 not implemented~~ — code shipped (`[~]`); live-verify folded into Issue 29.
- **Finish line (Issues 26–29) not started.** Path to "done": Issue 26 (licensed-only sourcing, AFK) + Issue 20 (live spike, HITL) → Issue 28 (unattended `gen_run` verify) → Issue 29 (first hybrid ship, two-gate). Issue 27 (housekeeping) is independent AFK.
- **AI-niche refit (Issues 30–34) shipped (2026-05-27).** Live-verify next `gen_run` for on-niche topics + Ken Burns framing. `spike-82` rejected manually; code/docs reconciled.
- **First live hybrid gen_run (Issues 35–38) planned (2026-05-30), not started.** Path: Issue 35 (resolve fetches-and-caches + cap 250¢, AFK) → Issue 36 (niche infra split, AFK) → Issue 37 (pre-billing narration policy, AFK, blocked by 35) → Issue 38 (live `gen_run` verify + HITL, supersedes Issue 20). No code written yet; `config.yaml` cap still 270.
- **Steady-state autonomy path (Issues 39–43) planned (2026-05-31), not started.** Path: Issue 39 (backfill-gate the 112-topic pre-gate backlog, AFK) + Issue 40 (fix/re-register scheduler XMLs, HITL) + Issue 41 (pin 2-clip count, AFK) → Issue 42 (enable schedule + hands-off sequencing, HITL; blocked by 39/40/41 + Issue 29 ship gate). Issue 43 (cumulative per-clip spend ceiling + shot-reuse-on-retry, AFK) — recommended before the hands-off flip since auto-top-up removed the balance backstop. Web review/calendar dashboard = explicit next-up follow-on, deferred (own grill/PRD).
- **Deferred (now retired as wrong fix):** niche-classifier prompt retune — the off-niche leak was a pre-gate backlog, not the prompt (see Issue 39). Scripter-framing drift logged as a deferred scripter-quality follow-up.
